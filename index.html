              I didn't start out with 215, 000 followers on Instagram. In fact,
              I used to look up to a lot of pages then and if "God When?" was a
              trendy phrase 5 years back I would have said it countless times.
            </p>
            <p class="">

              <li>
                You might have spent a lot of time, money and data trying to
                figure out how to make more sales using Instagram
              </li>
              <li>
                You might have paid for courses but did not understand a pin of
                what was taught
              </li>
              <li>
                You might have even tried to buy an Instagram page or do follow

              Hi, I'm Nelly Agbogu aka Naija Brand Chick and also Lolo 1 of
              Instagram.
            </p>
            <p>
              I actually didn't start out this big in business. In fact, I
              started small (in my kitchen) and just like everyone else that
              started small there was this desire to be successful. My products
              were good no doubt but who cares about good products if they don't
              know you?
            </p>
            <p>
              With this mind, I reached out to a couple of friends to help me
              showcase my products but those were closed doors. The influencers
              and social media manager charges were neck-breaking and did I feel
              depressed? YES. Did I feel left out? YES. Did I feel betrayed by
              the world? YES
            </p>
            <p>
              But here I am today, able to tell my story, able to lift small
              businesses from the ground to really high towers and this has
              become my life's mission: Helping Entrepreneurs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I simply decided to do things right. I said "Nelly, We Die Here
              Till We Succeed". I went through a series of training, put in the
              hard work and I can proudly call myself the Lolo 1 of Instagram
              because I learnt Instagram like I created the platform.
            </p>
            <p>With the knowledge gained, I have been able to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Earn six figures consistently</li>
              <li>Impact thousands of people around the world</li>
              <li>Host successful trade fairs</li>
              <li>Partner with big brands</li>
              <li>Get recognition and awards from different platforms</li>
              <li>and I can help you Make More Sales Using Instagram.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If that is your goal, I invite you to Dominate Instagram with my
              course

                    I worked with Naijabrandchick since 2019 and my sales
                    especially online skyrocketed. I went from selling 3 phones
                    a day to more than 10 phones a day through the tricks she
                    taught me. People now trust me and I can comfortably tell I
                    do more than 8 digits monthly.

                    Naijabrandchick did not only help me grow my business sales,
                    she changed my life. The Instagram strategies she gave me
                    helped me grow over 100,000 organic followers and also
                    helped me open my store in Lekki from Alaba. Who would have
                    thought that selling food equipment on Instagram can not
                    only make me an influencer but grow my business to a
                    multi-million company.

                    in content creation that has made me sell ₦100,000 every
