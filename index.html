              I didn't start out with 215, 000 followers on Instagram. In fact,
              I used to look up to a lot of pages then and if "God When?" was a
              trendy phrase 5 years back I would have said it countless times.
            </p>
            <p class="">
              This might be you too when you see those big pages on Instagram:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-phrases mx-3">
              <li>
                You might have spent a lot of time, money and data trying to
                figure out how to make more sales using Instagram
              </li>
              <li>
                You might have paid for courses but did not understand a pin of
                what was taught
              </li>
              <li>
                You might have even tried to buy an Instagram page or do follow
                for follow only to come back to where you started
              </li>

              Hi, I'm Nelly Agbogu aka Naija Brand Chick and also Lolo 1 of
              Instagram.
            </p>
            <p>
              I actually didn't start out this big in business. In fact, I
              started small (in my kitchen) and just like everyone else that
              started small there was this desire to be successful. My products
              were good no doubt but who cares about good products if they don't
              know you?
            </p>
            <p>
              With this mind, I reached out to a couple of friends to help me
              showcase my products but those were closed doors. The influencers
              and social media manager charges were neck-breaking and did I feel
              depressed? YES. Did I feel left out? YES. Did I feel betrayed by
              the world? YES
            </p>
            <p>
              But here I am today, able to tell my story, able to lift small
              businesses from the ground to really high towers and this has
              become my life's mission: Helping Entrepreneurs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I simply decided to do things right. I said "Nelly, We Die Here
              Till We Succeed". I went through a series of training, put in the
              hard work and I can proudly call myself the Lolo 1 of Instagram
              because I learnt Instagram like I created the platform.
            </p>
            <p>With the knowledge gained, I have been able to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Earn six figures consistently</li>
              <li>Impact thousands of people around the world</li>
              <li>Host successful trade fairs</li>
              <li>Partner with big brands</li>
              <li>Get recognition and awards from different platforms</li>
              <li>and I can help you Make More Sales Using Instagram.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If that is your goal, I invite you to Dominate Instagram with my
              course
            </p>
